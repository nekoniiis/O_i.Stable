Ultra-realistic, photorealistic portrait of a young woman with long, wavy brown hair, her face illuminated by soft, warm light, happily eating a piece of sushi with chopsticks in a cozy Japanese restaurant. She has a joyful, engaging expression, mouth slightly open as she brings the sushi towards it, looking slightly to her left.

She is wearing a form-fitting black long-sleeved ribbed top with a deep V-neck, revealing her cleavage, with two silver buttons visible on the placket. A delicate gold necklace with a small, distinct star-shaped pendant and possibly another tiny charm is visible on her chest. A simple gold band ring adorns her right ring finger.

She has visible tattoos: intricate small, dark ink designs on the skin of her right hand between the thumb and index finger, and on her upper chest, the Cyrillic word "МИСТЕЦТВО" (meaning 'Art' in Ukrainian) is tattooed clearly below her collarbone, accompanied by other subtle, small tattoos including what appears to be a tiny starburst near the necklace charm.

On the dark wooden table in front of her, there's a rectangular turquoise-glazed ceramic plate with more sushi rolls (some topped with sauce and microgreens), a small light grey ceramic bowl of miso soup with a black Asian-style soup spoon resting in it, and the top of a blue and yellow beverage can is partially visible to the left.

The restaurant setting includes warm wooden paneling in the background, a distinctively textured, wavy, light-colored ceiling structure, and soft, ambient lighting creating a comfortable atmosphere. The background elements of the restaurant are slightly blurred, emphasizing the subject.

Captured in a candid style, extremely high detail, sharp focus on the woman and the sushi she's holding. Emphasis on natural skin texture, realistic hair strands, and lifelike eyes. Shot as if with a DSLR camera, noticeable depth of field, cinematic lighting.
