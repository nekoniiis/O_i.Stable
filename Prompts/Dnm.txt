If you're over 30, get ready. Things have changed once again

Hey, I was born in the early 90s, and I believe the year 2000 was peak humanity, but we didn't know it at the time. Things changed very fast, first with the internet and then with smartphones, and now we're inevitably at a breaking point again.

TL:DR at the bottom

Those from the 80's and 90's are the last generation that was born in a world where technology wasn't embedded in life. We lived in the old world for a bit. Then the internet came in 1996, and it was fucking great because it was a part of life, not entwined with it. It was made by people who really wanted to be there, not by corporate. If you were there you know, it was very different. MSN, AIM, ICQ, IRC, MySpace, videogames that came full and working on release, no DLC bullshit and so on. We still had no access to music as if it was water from the tap, and we still cherished it. We lived in a unique time in human history. Now many of us look back and say, man, I wish I knew what I was doing that last time I closed MSN and never opened it again. That last time I went out to wander the streets with my friends with no real aim, and so on.

Then phones came. They evolved so fast and so out of nowhere that our brains haven't really adapted to it, we just went with the flow. All of us, from the dumbest to the smartest, from the poorest to the richest, we were flooded with tech and forced to use it if we wanted to live in modern society, and we're a bit slaves to it today.

The late 90's and early 2000's had the best of both worlds, a great equilibrium. Enough technology to live comfortably and well, but not enough to swallow us up and force itself into every crevice of our existence.

In just twenty years we went from a relatively tech free life to... now. We are being constantly surveilled, our data is mined all the time, every swipe of your card is registered, and your location is known always. You can't fart without having an ad pop up, and people talk to each other in real life less and less, while manufactured division is at an all time high, and no one trusts the governments, and no one trusts the media, unless you're a bit crazy or very old and grew up in a very different time. And you might not be nostalgic about the golden age of the internet, pre smartphone age, but it is evident things have changed too much in too short a time, and a lot not for the better.

Then AI shows up. It's great. Hell, I use it every day. Then image generation becomes a thing. Then it starts getting good real fast. Inevitably, video generation shows up after that, and even if we had promises like Sora at one point, we realized we weren't quite there yet when it came out for users. Then VEO 3 came out some days ago and, yeah, we're fucked.

This is what I'm trying to say: The state of AI today, is the worst it will ever be and it's already insane. It will keep improving exponentially. I've been using AI tools since November 2022. I prided myself in that I could spot AI. I fail sometimes now. I don't know if I can spot a VEO 3 video that is made to look serious and not absurd.

We laughed at old people that like and comment on evidently AI Facebook posts. Now I'm starting to laugh at myself. ChatGPT and MidJourney 3.5 and 4 respectively were in their Nokia 3310 moment. They quickly became BlackBerries. Now we're in iPhone territory. In cellphone to smartphone terms that took 7 years, from 2000 to 2007, and that change also meant they transformed from utility to necessity. AI has become a necessity in 3 years for those who use it, and its now it's changing something pretty fucked up, which is that we won't be able to trust anything anymore.

Where will we be in 2029 if, as of today, we can't tell an AI generated image or video from a real one if it's really well done? And I'm talking about us! the people using this shit day in and day out. What do we leave for those that have no idea about it at all?

So ladies and gentlemen, you may think I'm overreacting, but let me assure you I am not.

In the same way we had a great run with the internet from 96 to 2005 tops, (2010 if you want to really push it), I think we've had that equivalent time with AI. So be glad of the good things of the world of TODAY. Be glad you're sure that most users are STILL human here and in most other places. Be glad you can look at videos and tv or whatever you look at and can still spot AI here and there, and know that most videos you see are real. Be glad AI is something you use, but it hasn't taken over us like the internet and smartphones did, not yet. We're still in that sweet spot where things are still mostly real and humans are behind most things. That might not last for long, and all I can think of doing is enjoying every single day we're still here. Regardless of my problems, regardless of many things, I am making a decision to live this time as fully as I can, and not let it wash over me as I did from 98 to 2008. I fucked it up that time because I was too young to notice, but not again.

**TL-DR:** AI is comparable to the internet first and smartphones afterwards in terms of how fast and hard it will change our lives, but the next step also makes us not trust anything because it will get so good we won't be able to tell anymore if something is real or not. As a 90's kid, I'm just deciding to enjoy this last piece of time where we know that most things are human, and where the old world rules, in media especially, still apply. Those rules will be broken and changed in 2 years tops and we will have to adapt to a new world, again.
